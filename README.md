# Comment2Score

## Overview
Comment2Score, is an exploratory and analytical project focused on sentiment analysis derived from the Rate My Professors (RMP) website. The project aims to uncover insights into professor ratings, difficulty levels, and the overall sentiment from student reviews using various data science and machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes kernel density estimate plots, count plots, and various graphical representations to analyze star ratings, difficulty levels, and grade distributions from the dataset.
- **Approach 1 - Topic Modeling**: Employs topic modeling techniques to identify key themes in student reviews and evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics on star ratings and difficulty levels.
- **Approach 2 - Sentiment Intensity Analysis, Version 1**: Implements Sentiment Intensity Analysis to quantify the sentiment of reviews, followed by a detailed exploration of preprocessing steps, model architecture, and predictions.
- **Approach 3 - Sentiment Intensity Analysis, Version 2**: Offers an alternative or supplementary method for sentiment analysis, including unique preprocessing and analysis steps.
- **Miscellaneous**: Details about the dataset, its sources, and potential future directions for this research project.
